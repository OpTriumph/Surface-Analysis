# Surface-Analysis



To use such model for analysis, we use resampled cortical surface and their cortical thickness file. In our experiement, we use CIVET preprocessed files, where the cortical thickness files are .txt format.

In the script, load all the cortical thickness files (left and right seperate channel) into tensor shaped [N,40962, 2].

The surface vertex adjacency matrices that used in the model are in the folder Matrices_out.
